# JUnit5 Tests for project template

This branch contains the tests that work for all the project templates. To add the test to any project template, copy the `example` folder and the `DemoTest.java` to your project's test folder, which should look like this:

- **Desktop Project**: `client/src/test/java`
- **Web Project**: `demo/src/test/java`
- **Android Project**: `app/src/test/java`

These tests in the `example.data` package targets the `example.data` package, which can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/QUT-CAB302-Software-Development/share-files/archive/junit-data-package.zip).
